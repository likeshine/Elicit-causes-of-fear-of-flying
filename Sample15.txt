Honestly it would be awesome to have someone to talk to about this! I feel like I'm such a bother to my family and friends, because no one else is like this. Some may say they are 'scared' of flying, but it's not the same. I guess, like I said earlier, what freaks me out the most is while it is so incredibly rare, it does happen. Like the Ethiopian flight. And I can't imagine what it's like for those people when it's happening. Because I'm sure so many of them knew the statistics too, which made them feel like it could never actually happen to them.
