1,"Hi guys. So I've flown my whole life. But randomly, around the age of 13, I developed a terrible flying phobia. To the point my whole body goes cold when I'm on a plane, I cry in the airport, and I've even left the airport without getting on my flight. I haven't been on a plane in two years. Well, my parents planned a trip to Yellowstone with me and my boyfriend for August. This trip is very important to them, and I know it'll kill them if I don't go. My boyfriend and I are booked to fly from Charlotte to Chicago, and then Chicago to Bozeman. Both flights are on a Embraer ERJ-175. The Ethiopia plane crash has really made things worse for me. I keep thinking about how so many young, brilliant people were on that flight, and how horrific those 6 minutes of going up and down must've been for them. I think about how I'm sure there were fearful fliers on that flight. Fearful fliers who knew the statistics. 1 in an 11 million chance of a crash, and yet, it still happened to them. THEN, today at work, ( I'm a finance manager for a car dealership), I'm finishing up paperwork on a new truck with some guy. I ask him if he's excited. He says ' yeah, I bought it because we are going to Bozeman in August, and my wife is terrified to fly. So we are gonna drive in this.'... so I'm like, what are the chances we are having this conversation? Is this some weird super natural force telling me not to get on the plane? And I say this as someone who is not religious at all. I really would love some insight on all these issues from a few pilots. Thank you"
2,"Hello, I'm a pilot. I fly a CRJ-200 which is another regional airliner. You already seem to have an idea of the safety statistics which means your brain knows that flying is incredibly safe. You have to do your best (I know it's not always easy) to keep that at the forefront of your mind. The Ethiopian crash, as well as the Lion Air crash, are disturbing indeed. And I, like you, have spent a lot of time wondering what it must have been like for those passengers as they most likely would have known something was drastically wrong. The important thing to consider about those crashes though, is that once Boeing comes out with a fix for the issues that caused those crashes (which apparently they've already found) is that that plane will be the safest plane to be on. Without a doubt. See the thing about aviation is that although crashes are terrible, each crash that happens causes aviation to be safer. This is because investigators don't just stop once they find a cause for the accident, they don't stop until they find a fix for it. Once they find the main cause of an accident they then go about finding out what caused the cause. Were the pilots tired? Were they overworked? Was maintenance completely correctly on the aircraft? Are they any regulations that need to be looked at that could make things safer? We have a saying in aviation that our regulations were written in blood. It's morbid, but very true. Aviation is safer today than it was before the Ethiopian and Lion Air crashes happened. It's terribly sad that so many people lost their lives but their lives will not be lost in vain. Try to keep in mind that the aircraft involved in those accidents were a new type that hasn't been flying for very long. Somehow, the system that failed managed to get through an insane amount of testing and yet the faults fell through the cracks. This is incredibly rare and now that it's been found, it will be fixed and won't happen again. The plane you'll be flying on, the ERJ-175, has been flying for a number of years and has had no issues. You are going to be just fine. If you have any other questions or comments please feel free to message me. Cheers, Chax"
3,"Honestly, my biggest fear is how it would feel right before we die in a crash. I hate rollercoasters. I HATE when they drop and how that feels. I think about how, on a plane crash, it would probably feel like that, but times a thousand. I could be totally wrong though. I've been thinking about getting some counseling from Ron Nielsen, he's a pilot that now teaches fearful flier courses. Do you know of him? When I was 14, my parents sent me to a therapist for my fear of flying, but she didn't really seem to know what to do. We only had one meeting, which she told me in it, ' the average crash only last 13 seconds.' Like that is supposed to be comforting or something. 13 seconds would seem like an eternity when you're terrified."
4,"So anything else that causes fear/anxiety for you? Falling? Heights? Claustrophobia? Fear of being trapped or restrained? etc. I probably should have included this up front: I'm also a commercial pilot. Have been for 25 years, flying everything from little Cessnas to regional turboprops/jets to the 737NG and 737 Max for a major airline- so if you have specific questions about that, particularly about the 737, feel free to ask. I'm not familiar with the pilot/therapist you mentioned. I've worked with therapists and their fear-of-flying patients in the past, though, so I do have a little bit of background. One therapy session is about as good as zero therapy sessions :) You could very well benefit from a good therapist."
5,"I suppose I do have a bit of a fear of heights. My boyfriend and I are both pretty serious hikers/ trail runners/ mountain bikers. We live in the Appalachians. However, I am terrified of getting too close to the edge to look out over cliffs. I start to feel light headed and like I'm going to fall right off. The space inside planes don't bother me. I'm fine with being inside tight spaces. It's really imaging how horrible it would feel while the plane was crashing. Also, the recent crash/fire on a commercial airplane in Russia last month also freaked me out. What did you think of that?"
6,"Bad circumstances and poor pilot decision-making are apparently to blame for that one. The full report isn't out. That plus the fact that we're talking about Russia, here, means that there may be some gaps between reality and what is reported. But the short of it seems to be that they landed overweight, bounced, and should have gone around, but tried to force a landing anyway, which caused a structural failure and fire. But let's talk about your situation: The EMB-175 is an excellent airplane with an excellent safety record. I love riding on them. IMO the best regional jet ever made. I have a lot of friends who fly it (some of them might be flying you). Your flight will be flown in the US, by competent pilots who've undergone very good training, in the safest airspace pretty much anywhere. It sounds very centrist and sort of politically incorrect to say it: But you kind of have to take note of where all these crashes you've mentioned have happened. They aren't US operated airplanes with US crews, maintained to US standards in US airspace. Say what you will, we have a fantastic safety record here. You'll be flying in the best conditions pretty much anywhere on the planet. The interesting thing about the aviation community is how we tend to respond to an accident. We generally nitpick the thing, examine it clinically, and figure out pretty rapidly how to not have that happen again and fix whatever caused it. And I'll say it again, because you have to sort of put all this into perspective-- the obsession people in general and the media specifically have over plane incidents is really misplaced. There are so many everyday things that are more dangerous than flying, but they don't make spectacular news stories. You kind of have to get yourself into a place where you don't give the drama surrounding an aviation incident much credit or thought, because, in reality, beyond looking really crazy on TV or whatever, there just isn't much to it in the grander scheme of things. Here's a list of really mundane things that are very common ways to croak, but just don't have that news-story pull to make it into 24-hour ""look at THIS"" cycle-- all of these together kill exponentially more people than plane crashes."
7,"This is completely normal and probably the #1 root cause of flying anxiety/fear. Totally understandable, really. You're being sealed up in an aluminum tube where you really don't even understand how the door operates and trusting a crew you've never met or possibly not even seen to take you safely to your destination at incredibly high speed and altitude. You're right to have apprehension-- it's how our species has survived for so long; we're naturally paranoid and don't like to be feel trapped in unfamiliar or potentially dangerous places. All normal. What you have to do is teach your higher-functioning mind to override your more primitive instincts. You do that by learning as much as you can about airplanes, pilots/flight crews, and air travel as you can. The more you know, the less traction your noisy primitive side can gain intrude on your better-reasoning mind. I even recommend that people with flying anxiety try to work out at least a discovery flight with a flight instructor at some point. First thing you need to know and understand is this: If I, as the pilot, get there OK, then clearly you get there OK. I have exactly zero interest in bending the airplane I'm flying or getting hurt by bending the airplane I'm flying. I will use every bit of my experience, training and skill to avoid those situations. I don't take chances with my airplane or crew, and I've been flying for 25 years with closing in on 20,000 hours of total flight time. If I'm OK, you're definitely OK. Ask questions. Lots of them. What do you want to know? What happens on flights that you don't understand? Answering these questions gets you moving towards getting over your fear enough to get on with your life."
8,"If you're flying on a regional jet like the EMB-175, particularly to a small town like Bozeman, that is never going to be mainline, it's always a regional contractor airline; in this case Skywest. There are about 30 regional airlines in the US that provide feed from smaller cities to the hubs for larger airlines. This is very common since it's not profitable to operate large airplanes into and out of smaller airports where there just isn't enough passenger traffic to justify the expense- so they contract with somewhat smaller airlines who operate smaller jets. 25 years old is pretty average for a regional pilot nowadays. Some of the new pilots there are likely younger than that. I work for a mainline legacy carrier, and even we get new-hire pilots in their 20s. All of these pilots are held to the same training environment and standards, regardless of who they work for. Your pilots, while possibly quite young, have plenty of experience, are very well-trained, and are flying basically brand-new airplanes. Their safety record is excellent. There really isn't a 'main pilot.' We have captains (left seat, pilot-in-command) and first officers (second-in-command). Depending on where they are in their duty day, either of them could be actually flying the jet. We trade off duties every other flight, so if I'm pilot-flying on a leg from Phoenix to San Francisco, for instance, the other pilot is the pilot-monitoring. I physically fly the airplane while the other pilot runs radios, checklists, etc. When we get to SFO, we'll switch duties and the other pilot will be PF and physically fly while I perform pilot-monitoring (PM) duties for the leg back to PHX. It ensures we are always rested, alert, and are getting equal flying experience. The philosophy in the US is that we don't hire co-pilots; we hire people who will make good captains, who have the skills and judgement to sit in that captain seat now, even though they still need to have enough time with the airline before they can actually hold the captain's seat."
9,"It fails to address the fact that the number of people flying has also increased. More frequency and volume of travel equals a proportionate (slight) increase in incidents. Did you notice the numbers in the article? 4.3 billion (with a B) people flew as passengers just last year. Less than 600 fatalities out of 4.3 billion people who flew. Your chances of getting struck by lightning are better (1 in 3000 over your lifetime). hell if you're outdoors a lot in the Appalachians, your risk of lighting strike is probably even higher than that average."
10,"Thank you for this. Also, a crash that has always terrified me is the AirFrance 447 crash in 2009. I guess what has always really, really bothered me about this one. From what I've gathered from the story, everything on the flight was actually 100% okay. The co-pilot actually created the whole issue himself. It seemed as though he was extremely worried about flying through a storm, and because of this fear, panicked and ultimately caused the crash. This terrifies me. The human factor of flying. How do I know my pilot won't panic and kill us all? Lol. But seriously."
11,"That's actually not what happened at all. The problem was unreliable/erroneous airspeed indications caused by faulty pitot tubes (the pitot tubes measure airspeed) that became clogged with ice. The autopilot disengaged and the fly-by-wire flight control system entered alternate-law (which basically means that the airplane handed over all control to the pilots). There was some pilot error involved in that the pilots had difficulty hand-flying the airplane as well as their being unable to diagnose the faulty-airspeed problem. I can see why this one scares you because of your apparent fear of falling. Most likely, the passengers had no idea this was even happening. The airplane wouldn't feel like it was falling out from under you in this situation; everything would still be at 1g. It was basically like a falling leaf. Even the recent Max crashes probably didn't really give much of a ""falling"" feeling-- it most likely just felt like a rapid descent up till the last moment. The airplanes didn't just drop from the sky, they transitioned into a high-speed dive. Different. But anyway, what I'm picking up on here is some pretty normal fear-of-flying things: Fear of falling in something you can't get out of. Fear of being out of control. Fear of not being able to escape. These are all normal. Hell, I get the same sensations when I'm riding in the back as a passenger, and I know more about what's going on than pretty much every other passenger. I'm not the most comfortable passenger at all, for sure. When I was younger I had a pretty serious fear of flying, even though I did it quite a bit."
12,"Human-factor causes/issues are something we, the FAA, the training department, discuss pretty much all the time. I'd say that right now, we know more about human factors in aviation and how to mitigate the risks associated with them than we ever have in the past. I really can't think of a single incident in the whole 25 years or so that I've been flying that can be completely attributable to just simply some pilot panicking/freaking out and crashing."
13,"Well first of all, you have to understand flying is just weird and unnatural. Flying high above ground, in enclosed tight space, with insane speeds, what's not there to be afraid of? Well actually next to nothing, but our instincts are often quick to tell us the opposite. It's common thing, chances are there are many people with you on any flight that are afraid or used to be afraid of flying. Yet in the in the end, it's our brains that are just not able to work with statistics very well when it comes to those fears. Chances are you know all about the recent plane crashes that happened worldwide and at the same time, are completely ignorant on all the car crashes, people killed on the streets etc. Do you sometimes walk outside in storm? Well statistically speaking, chances of being struck by lightning (and dying of it) are greater than dying in plane crash. It may be a bit morbid suggestion, but maybe watch some good documents (Mayday / ACI for example) about plane crashes (just preferably older, fully investigated) . You'll learn lots of stuff, how many unlikely things must happen prior to any real emergency (as often said, all accidents in aviation are results of chain of events) and even when those happens as unlikely as they are, that nothing is lost. All fuel lost flying over Atlantic? Plane (civilian, big jetliner) shot with rocket with wing on fire? Broken cockpit window and captain pulled out of the plane? All power lost during most dangerous phase of flight? Yet nobody died and pilots brought the planes back to safety. So, I suggest you talk to your boyfriend, tell him your fears, there isn't anything to be ashamed of, just don't act on them, they're irrational fears. Chances of anything happening on that flight are next to zero, you're much more likely to win lottery big time. And even if something were to happen (chances are next to zero though), you'll be in good hands, with people trained for those situations that will do everything possible (and sometimes even impossible :-D) to bring you back to safety. And remember, when you arrive to the airport by your car / bus / whatever, the most dangerous part of the travel is over, so you may very well relax ;-)"
14,"100% not a pilot and never will be, because we are identical in this regard, haha! It's horrible, and to be perfectly honest, I take Ativan, Benadryl, and (when I'm not pregnant), booze. But the Ativan and Benadryl have worked wonderfully. I'm miserable until I take them, I'm still jumpy and anxious, but it takes that awful, awful, edge off. I know some will push back on this, but drastic times call for drastic measures. I know the feelings you're feeling! I also have a background in meteorology so I can decipher upper level atmosphere maps and my friend does turbulence forecasts for me. Are you taking about that 'Fly Home' fear of flying course/therapy? I was thinking about that as well! Let me know if you want to be phobia buddies - for real - no one else understands how I feel and it'd be nice to talk to someone before flights!"
15,"Honestly it would be awesome to have someone to talk to about this! I feel like I'm such a bother to my family and friends, because no one else is like this. Some may say they are 'scared' of flying, but it's not the same. I guess, like I said earlier, what freaks me out the most is while it is so incredibly rare, it does happen. Like the Ethiopian flight. And I can't imagine what it's like for those people when it's happening. Because I'm sure so many of them knew the statistics too, which made them feel like it could never actually happen to them."
16,"Yes!! I think about that all the time. For whatever reason the Air France one a few years ago has really gotten to me. There were definitely people like us on these flights. Sometimes I think my anxiety and fear is almost protective In a way. I also used to think, before I became really anxious, that there is no way the plane could crash with babies and little kids on board. Definitely not true, of course. I'm absolutely rotten to my my husband mainly before flying. No one gets it. Once you're up in the air, you can't get out of there. I'm not claustrophobic, but on planes I am. I subscribe to the FlightAware newsletter which helps some, as it'll give updates on accident analyses and it helps to see people casually talk about flying like it isn't any big thing. FlightAware the app is like my talisman as well. You can just track your flight the whole time you're on it (for when you're not on a JetBlue or similar where they have the TVs that do that for you). Sorry this is so rambling! PM me anytime and I'm happy to commiserate!"
17,"I'm writing this 36,000ft above the coast of Albania. My stomach is an icy mass, I want to cry, and an ache that begins in my thighs intensifies down my legs, reaching a soggy apogee in the soles of my feet, where the nerve endings are continuously, painfully primed for landing. I'm on a plane for the fourth time in six weeks, and I'm scared of flying. Facing my fear: I was scared of flying. Then my plane nearly crashed I know many want to help, so let me start by saying: for me, at least, the statistics don't make me feel better. It's the safest form of travel! You're more likely to be harmed in the taxi on the way there; you're more likely to die in your own bathtub; you're more likely to brain yourself on the front doorstep after slipping on a slug. I don't dispute the facts, although I haven't checked the bathtub one (I daren't turn on the wifi). One of my uncles died of the head injuries he incurred slipping on a slug while drunk, and I've never known anyone who's been involved in an air crash, so I'm sold in terms of both anecdote and data on the statistical safety of flying. It's just that it doesn't stop me wanting to run screaming from the departure lounge. People who fly happily think not unreasonably that nothing bad will happen. Those of us who are scared are fixated on the knowledge that it might. There's an egotism here, a deeply skewed belief that the fact of my existence is so significant that it must irresistibly draw down the most numerically unlikely catastrophe. I'm also convinced that the emotional force of my terror is somehow important. If I stop worrying if I read, sleep or listen to Kermode and Mayo, we will fall out of the sky. This applies only to me: other people doing it is fine. Landing in New York, the only long-haul flight I have taken in 30 years, I was completely exhausted by the effort of keeping the plane in the air. Oh, as Dr Seuss nearly said, the places I won't go. Of course, we're not scared of flying: we're scared of crashing. There's nothing irrational about being conscious of your vulnerability when you're cruising some way above the level of the Hillary Step. It's a cocktail of some of the most common fears: falling from a great height, enclosed spaces, having no control. It's also borne of an overactive imagination, of picturing the kind of death it would be, conscious and free-falling. The second worst scenario, for me, involves sliding into uncontrolled panic in front of a baffled audience. On a flight some years ago I saw an elegant young woman roll up her jumper, lay it between her head and the window, and fall asleep before takeoff. This is the kind of traveller I aspire to be, rather than a wet-footed, half-drunk hysteric strung tighter than piano wire. Take off is the worst, but descending is also awful, as the engines suddenly get quieter and your duodenum appears in the back of your throat. It's got worse with age. Among people I know, the brotherhood of the nervous expands each year. A friend who makes a living by writing about foreign cities has to go everywhere by boat or train or car. A corporate lawyer cannot avoid flying, but it makes her miserable. Another friend planning the holiday of a lifetime to Canada sympathises: 'Oh God, I hate it too.' Perhaps it's contagious. On this flight, on take-off, a woman two rows in front of me buried her face in her hands while her husband rubbed her arm; I was torn between wanting to offer solidarity, and wanting to ask her to get a grip, because she was adding an extra level of freak to my already considerable freak levels. I settle for doing neither and instead retreat to pretending that Tom Hanks is on my flight. I do this often, because he is the world's most reassuring presence, and will surely not die on a tourist shuttle from Epirus. But through it all, I know, obscurely, that later on tonight I will be at home, falling asleep to the sound of planes overhead. I grew up under the Heathrow flight path and live beneath it still, near the great reservoirs west of London that mark the way home. Each night I'm lulled by the roar of engines above my head and imagine passengers in the low lights of nighttime cabins, heading to Dublin or Dallas, or Delhi or Dubai; business or pleasure, home or away. And somehow I know that they, like me, will almost certainly have a safe journey."
18,"It's all about mindset. Some education about flying is fine, but don't overdo it. Otherwise, you are trapped in the mental exercise of reassurance seeking. That just more anxiety-inducing behavior, not progress. A couple of times I used lorazepam and it helped. But, flying on meds creates side effects and wasted time recovering from drug hangovers. I typically travel with my family and I have responsibilities as a husband and father. I didn't want to be drugged. I wanted to really overcome the fear for myself and my family. My son in particular. I want to travel with him as much as possible as he gets older. right now he's 2.5 yo and a great traveler, so he inspired me as well.  This is something I wrote on Instagram that people liked about grit and a framework of what gave me the best results so I could get on the plane again and again. Why do we need grit when overcoming flight anxiety and fear? ? ? It has been shown that your mood, and attitude to life, will interfere with your ability to stay the course and solve problems.? ? The key is to learn: ? emotion regulation, and? a positive thinking style.? ? In order to achieve the goal of flying with confidence, rather than apprehension, we need to stick at things despite hard times.? ? Sticking with the hard times, emotional regulation, and a positive thinking style! ? ? This is the ready, SET, go! framework of flying like a boss! ? ? S-Stick with hard times.? You may be uncomfortable. You may feel like you have lost control, but you will be ok. The hard times will pass and in place, strength is developed for future events! ?Trust me! ? E-Emotional regulation.? Your emotions will get the best of you and create the illusion of extreme danger! Challenging negative thinking, reframing nervous feelings as excitement, HRV breathing are your tools to regulate your emotional system! ? ? T- Thinking positive.? Imagine a fantastic flight weeks and days until the event. Imagine the great experiences you have to look forward to. Think about past successes. Think about how common flying is and how your flight is just a regular thing that happens day in, day out because of the incredibly robust systems in place to keep you safe. 1,000,000 flights everyday with no issues! You only hear about the minute percentage of events in the news that mess with your thinking. What about all the millions of great flights that happen all the time? ?"
19,"I have 3 children under 6 so yes, Flying is important to me. Also making my wife happy, in turn, would make me happy. As a dad myself, I had similar feelings. I took Xanax but still felt fine to function."
20,"Something interesting you can try is coming up with a very positive, emotionally charged image that creates a burst of oxytocin in your body. I used the memory of my son being born and seeing him for the first time. When I reframed anxiety as excitement I also brought this memory to mind so I got the reframing and the oxytocin. What helped me the most is just sitting with the discomfort. Imagine your body melting the fear, ask for more. Asking to make it stronger confuses the anxiety and turns it down because you are not resisting it. The anticipation is the worse part for some. So, know that you just need to get through the first part and the takeoff. It is challenging flying with kids, so plan everything out as much is possible to lessen your stress load. Keep the meds with you as a comfort , but think what would change about the flight if you took a pill?"
21,"Visualization is your friend. Go over in your mind everything from arrival at the airport to landing at your destination. Rehearse what you will say, anticipate questions people may ask, know what you will do if you are asked to give upnyour seat due to overbooking, etc. Remember that you don't have to be first in line to board, or the first out of your seat when you land. If you are stressed by crowds stay to the back of the lines and don't rush. Pack lightly and keep what you will need in your carry on. Headphones and your most calming jams will centre you while you are waiting.  Above all, remember you have chosen the safest mode of travel and don't let ""what ifs"" get you uptight."
22,Download a game to your phone! I flew to Costa Rica in January and was so focused on beating the game that I didn't notice any turbulence or any of the things that would usually make me anxious on a flight.
23,"It's a mental game. Fear does not mean danger! If you are feeling anxious before or during the flight, remind yourself that fear does not mean you are in danger It's important to separate your anxiety from danger in these circumstances since your body reacts to both the same. Realize your body is doing its job by trying to keep you from a perceived threat that's not really dangerous."
24,Exactly! What I learned from this applies to mindset in any area that creates a fear response. Stay in the present. Do HRV breathing reframe anxiety as excitement. Literally say to yourself that you're excited each time. Go over my framework and keep positive! Get on that plane and feel successful for doing it. Don't criticize yourself ever
25,"Exposure therapy. If you're scared of something, sometimes it really helps to jump in and own it. Knowledge can help you overcome fear and anxiety."
26,"Learning about how flight works. Learning about how common flying is everyday. Yours is one of 100,000's of fights everyday that are successful. Learn about turbulence and why it's no big deal. That's a start! I overcame my fears after 5 years of having flight anxiety of some form and strength. I fly fine now."
27,"Similar, but was an 8 year stop. I decided my wife and kids were owed a family trip. Lots of exercise, lots of praying, and some Xanax."
28,Xanax.
29,"The short answer is education and exposure. Learn everything you can about airplanes and flying. Talk to pilots (Im a pilot, so you can start with me if you like). Identify what it is that scares you/makes you anxious about flying with most people its the sense of loss-of-control and/or fear of new/unfamiliar situations and sensations. Understand that its genuinely more life-threatening to do almost any day-to-day activity vs. flying. Aviation accidents are over-covered in the news and media- they sensationalize the tragedy in a way thats designed to make you afraid and keep you tuned in to their feed. In a way, youre being manipulated into being afraid. Hundreds of thousands people are injured or killed (really, seriously) from driving or riding in a car, being accidentally poisoned, falling in/around the home, being caught in residential fires, or by choking. The number hurt or killed in aviation accidents is absolutely tiny compared to other accidental causes. Its more dangerous to get out of bed and take a shower in a wet bathroom, or to get in your car and go to the store than it is to be a passenger on an airplane, you're just conditioned to accept the everyday risks as 'normal' and the flying risks as extraordinary. And if you need a little therapy and some Xanax to get on a plane, thats fine. Its OK. But educating yourself about flying and the things that affect a flight (like weather), goes a really long way towards getting you away from fear and into the realm of being well-informed and more-rationally unafraid. It never completely goes away. I fly for a living (when I was younger I had a pretty strong fear of flying) and still don't particularly like riding as a passenger. Being a little anxious about it is totally normal."
30,"Hesistant flyer here - love your username lol. I'm flying this week for the first time in over 7 years, I'm actually feeling ok due to all the research I've done these last few years. I have grown to love planes and have even become somewhat of a spotter. Mechanically, would any problems present themselves once the plane is in the air that you wouldn't see on the ground? Has that ever happened to you? Also, once the plane is at cruise altitude on autopilot - are the engines basically doing what they're meant to do? I always get this bad thought of the engines doing something crazy when we're up high. Thanks in advance for your words of reassurance!"
31,"Well, let's be realistic: It's a machine. So sure, things can fail once you're airborne even if everything looks OK and checks out on the ground. Has it happened to me? Sure. It happens sometimes. Usually it's a minor component or has a redundant system so it's not a big deal at all. We run the appropriate checklist/procedure and fix the issue. In the rare event the issue can't be fixed, and it's something important for safety, we find the nearest appropriate airport and land safely. Even something major like an engine failing, if it happens at altitude, isn't a big deal-- at altitude, you don't need excessive amounts of engine power to stay in the air, so the airplane can return to earth and land absolutely fine even if one engine completely quits. There are oceanic routes flown with two-engine airplanes, and we have to plan for the airplane to fly hundreds of miles on one engine to get to an appropriate place to land if one of the engines happens to fail over water."
32,"The engines are under extremely low stress when cruising up high at altitude. They are under the most operating stress at takeoff power when you're rolling down the runway and for the first 1000' or so of climb till we pull the power back slightly for the rest of the climb to altitude. Just to give you an idea of just how much power we have available in a modern jet or turboprop: We don't usually take off at the maximum thrust setting for the engines. It wastes fuel and causes excessive wear and tear to use maximum power. The more you can avoid excessive wear and tear on the engines, the more reliable they'll be when you really need them for something. Usually we take off with anywhere from about 75-85% of max available thrust. If we need that extra power, it is absolutely there at our disposal, and we will use it, it's just not operationally necessary 95% of the time. If the engines are going to do something ""bad"" or quit, having them do it up at altitude is the best time for it to happen. Think about all the potential energy a jet cruising at 3x,000 feet has. Even if both engines quit, we generally have about 7 miles of altitude between us and the earth. Descending at about 1500 feet per minute, it would take about 24 minutes to descend from the average cruise altitude to the earth, and we could cover a distance of about 120 miles from the point the engines failed until we reached the earth-- that's more than enough time to find a place to land and/or plan for a safe off-airport landing."
33,"Thanks kind reddit stranger! This definitely makes me feel better. I guess I have a hard time trusting that all these pieces (machine, human pilot, ATC) just WORK, but I need to learn to let go once in a while!"
34,"Think of it this way: The airplane without the pilots is just a hunk of aluminum sitting on the ramp, a static display. The pilots without the airplane are just some random people who like to hang out at airports. The airplane and pilots together are completely on their own and very limited in what they can do without ATC. The whole thing is the machine/mechanism that gets people and stuff where they/it need to be; the individual pieces are pretty worthless by themselves."
35,I'm a 26 year old adult female who has never been on a plane before and I finally fly somewhere in 2 weeks! I am very excited about this adventure I'm about to endure but I am so nervous about flying on a plane. I know planes are very safe and it can be very exciting. I think what makes me nervous is that it is an unknown for me; I have never experienced it so I'm not sure what to expect. I just want to be calm on the flight and not have these terrifying thoughts continuously going through my head. Any advice to help overcome my fear would be much appreciated! Thanks
36,"The hardest part for most people I think is not being in control. And further to that, not knowing what's going on as well. Being 10s of thousands of feet in the air in a metal tube is not normal and combine that with not being in control, and not always knowing what's going, on and it can be a scary situation. The first thing I would say if that you have to trust your flight crew. Flight crews are among the highest trained personel out there. Not only are they highly trained, but they are tested regularly. Flight attendants are required to undergo yearly recurrent training and for pilots it's insane. Firstly, before we even get near the plane we have to have completed a 4-6 week course on the aircraft. (This is after we've completed all of our initial pilot training by the way) Typically the first two weeks are simply learning the systems on board the aircraft, and the next 2-4 weeks are spent in a full-motion simulator where we put that knowledge to the test and learn how to handle the aircraft in many different emergency scenarios. After that's completed we undergo what we call line indoc training (I'm Canadian and I believe they call it Operational Experience in the States). During line indoc training we'll fly with senior captains and learn the ropes, so to speak. Once that's completed we do a line check with an even more senior check captain. After that, we are considered to finally be fully trained. But that training only lasts for 6 months. After 6 months we go back into the sim and redo our emergency training. This is required every 6 months. In addition, line checks are required every year. The next aspect I would ask you to consider is the safety and reliability of today's airliners. The redundancy is astounding. Everything has a backup. Even the backups have backups. And a lot of those backups also have backups. For example, before an airliner can be certified to carry passengers it must demonstrate that it is fully capable of flying safely after an engine failure at the worst possible time (right at take off) and in the worst-case scenario (maximum weight, full aft centre of gravity, etc). This means that any airliner you're on is fully capable of losing an engine at take off while fully loaded and yet still safely continue flying. If there are any more specific aspects of flying that concern you let me know and I'll respond to those issues directly. Otherwise enjoy the flight! Flying is amazing and the views are spectacular. I've been flying for 12 years and I still love the view from my office! Cheers!"
37,Honestly the only thing that really makes me feel better is having a few drinks before I get on the plane. But obviously that can be a dangerous suggestion if you're the type of person who might accidentally go overboard.
38,"Hey, thank you sooo much for your reply I really appreciate it! It's really good to know how much training goes into it and that no matter what there is always a way to safely land/fly. This definitely put my mind at ease a bit more. Thank you for your detailed reply :)"
39,Hey thank you for getting back to me! I don't know why I'm so worried lol I think maybe the biggest thing that scares me is taking off. I know it's a short period of time and once you're in the air it's all okay. I don't know I think I'm overthinking everything! I get bad thoughts in my head too and I know it's much safer to fly in a plane than to drive in a car lol
40,"Not sure how active this subreddit is, but I'm getting ready for a flight from Jacksonville to Baltimore and then Baltimore to Pittsburgh. At first I thought I was going to feel fine, but as I get closer to takeoff at 6:50 and see it storming here in Jax and in Baltimore, I'm starting to lose my cool. I thought I could do it, but the thought of taking off and landing in stormy weather is really getting to me."
41,Try your best to keep in mind that the pilots up front are very highly trained and they will not take you flying unless they feel it is absolutely safe to do so. Yes you may experience some turbulence and I certainly understand why that can be scary but the plane is perfectly capable of handling it (and much much much more). Remember too that the pilots have families and friends they want to see after the flight so they're not going to go if they don't think it's safe.
42,"Thank you for your insight! My flight actually ended up being fine. It was pretty bumpy at times, but I did a lot better with it than I thought I would. The wait (and anxiety) before take-off was definitely worse than actually being up in the air."
43,"Hey all, I've always had a fear of flying and a fear of heights. I think the latter feeds the former and then I feel trapped in this metal tube 30k feet up. As soon as I realize where I am (up really high) I go into a fight or flight response and can't calm down. This has led to panic attacks in the past. Does anyone else have the same experience? If so, what helps you to keep your mind at ease and possibly keep these thoughts from setting in? Thanks"
44,I get drunk before I fly. Not exactly the most sustainable plan ..
45,"Normal. I don't think anyone 'loves' heights. It's more of an agoraphobia feeling. Which is the fear of having a panic attack. Specifically, this could be fear of having a panic attack at 30K. I took Xanax for my last flight, helped a little bit. Enough for me to get to Cancun and back."
46,"Update....I landed and the experience was better than other flights. I thought I'd share some things I did. -Used medication (benzo) -Had a rubber band on my wrist that I snapped when 'bad thoughts' crept in -before the flight, watched a scene in a show where people were on a plane and pictured myself in the situation and processed my thoughts -realized that my anxiety was made worse by not being confident that I could do it"
47,"Hi everyone, I have a flight coming up in a few weeks back to the east coast and I've been anxious for it this entire month. I've flown about 7-8 times this year for work but I am an absolute mess before and during and just get anxious the entire time. Anyone have any tips to help this? I was thinking of staying up the entire night before (it's a 6 am flight) and taking some zzzquil to just pass out before take-off hopefully. I worry about a fire or engine problem while the air. I've had an awful experience on board a plane with a sparking/grinding engine while we were in the air and we had to make an emergency landing. After that I've just been a mess every time. I also thought about just taking a train or driving back across the country for 3,000 miles, which I know is ridiculous and statistically less safe but it just makes me feel a lot better. This is more expensive and more inconvenient but really would keep my mind at ease. I want to get over the fear of flying though and I don't think this does anything for it. Basically I only fly out of necessity and it has NOT gotten better from more exposure. If anything I'm even more nervous. Can you guys help me? I know statistically it's quite safe but it does nothing for me being 30k feet in the air. Thanks for any advice."
48,"Pilot here: This is the sort of thing that is a major part of our recurrent training cycles (we don't just learn these things once and never touch them again-- we train for it all the time). All of us are well-versed in what to do and how to handle engine problems/fires/shutdowns, etc., as you found after you landed from your inflight emergency without a scratch on you. Your pilots have an even stronger sense of self-preservation than you do. I have no interest in an inflight problem leading to something dire. If I'm OK, you'll be OK. Coincidentally, the airplane will fly just fine even if both engines quit. We're not going to fall out of the sky just because we lose power. Yep, we train for that scenario also. If you have any questions or concerns I can address, I'll be happy to share with you what I know and what I do."
49,Thanks for this.. I basically know I'll be fine but it's just rather frightening to me. I keep telling myself it's just one more trip I have to make for the next year or so. Do you recommend first class for nervous flyers? I got an upgrade and have my own suite to myself on JetBlue which I'm looking forward to. It leans back into a bed and I'm really going to try and sleep.
50,"First class is nice. Definitely more comfy. A little more attention from the flight attendants. Less stressful, probably. I have several friends who fly for JetBlue. Really good people. You'll be fine."
51,"Hi there, Whenever I fly, I'm afraid of many irrational things. I'm trying to dispel some of my fear by knowing a bit how airplanes work. I'd like to know what is the angle at which an airplane would stall when banking, assuming there is such a thing. Whenever I'm flying, I feel like the banking angle is pretty steep, but it may as well be just my perception of it. I'm also interested in knowing if an awfully strong jet/gust of wind perpendicular to one wing could stall a banking plane, or if any other wind conditions could affect a plane when banking. I feel some of these questions are silly, in fact they probably are. My irrational self isn't particularly clever or informed, sorry :(!"
52,There is no set bank angle at which an airplane will stall. It's dependant on a number of factors. The most important of which being airspeed. As long as the airspeed is high enough you can bank up to 90 degrees or more without stalling. Past a certain bank angle the plane won't be able to stay in level flight (maintain altitude) but it won't be stalled. Meaning it's still fully under control. This situation should never occur on an airliner but I just wanted to let you know that it's perfectly safe if it did.
53,Yep. I promise you it's just your perception. Flying isn't a natural feeling to most people and if you're not used to it (or just dead scared of it) then your body tends to make it seem worse than it is. The maximum bank angle we use when turning is 30 degrees. Typically though we use around 15 degrees of bank.
54,"There is one type of phenomenon that could cause this. It's called wake turbulence. When a plane moves through the sky is creates wake turbulence. Much like a boat on the water. The larger the plane, the worse the turbulence they create. If a small plane is following too closely to a large plane then the wake turbulence could absolutely have a dangerous affect on the smaller plane. This has happened in the past. That's why Air Traffic Control has strict separation minima. There is a minimum distance that must be kept at all times between planes and the minimum distance is increased when it's a smaller plane following a larger plane."
55,"An airplane will stall no matter how fast you fly. The space shuttle, for example, reenters the atmosphere doing over Mach 20 in a full stall. Every pilot, including me, is aware and have trained for what's called 'accelerated stalls'. On the contrary, an airplane will not stall no matter the bank angle so long as you're not pulling very hard on the controls. You're thinking of windsheer (as well as wake turbulence, probably). All that is is just the wind changing direction suddenly. All you'll feel are some bumps and maybe small sinking feelings but it's normal."
56,"Did any of you aerophobic solo travelers successfully overcome your fear of flying? I'm talking about ""I'd rather take 1600km of terrestrial transportation than fly for two hours"" fear. I LOVE travelling, especially solo but this fear is so ingrained in me, it's almost a part of my personality. Imagine a cat on a jet-ski. That's how I feel in an airplane. Sooo any tips except for exposure - therapy? Any tips on how to travel by land / sea cheaply? Thanks."
57,"I overcame my intense fear of flying to the point that I got my pilot's license. I couldn't get on an airplane without being medicated - seriously, my doctor prescribed me Lorazepam specifically for flying only after I told him that my strategy was to get black out drunk to get in the air. It's a weird dichotomy of being both a completely rational and irrational fear at the same time. You can cite safety statistics all day long about how objectively safe air travel is, but that doesn't matter to the skittish flier. It's a rational fear, in my opinion, because of how fundamentally unnatural the act of flying is for a human. I've always been a frequent traveler and this fear hindered my ability to enjoy and especially look forward to wherever I was going because the fear of the flight always was my first thought. Then on one particular trip, something just clicked. I was on a terrible business trip and had just got on my fourth flight of the day. I think it was a combination of being exhausted and just wanting to get to my destination - some crappy motel 6 in the middle of nowhere that I still had 90 minutes to drive to after landing. Anyway, there was rough turbulence early in the flight, but instead of death-gripping the armrest like I normally would, I just started laughing to myself and thought ""Whatever happens, happens. It might as well, and I just don't care anymore."" I realized in that moment that my fear of flying was rooted in feeling like I was in control. When you sit in an aluminum tube 6 miles above the ground going 600 mph, the last thing you feel is in control. So I managed to trick my mind into ceding that control for a moment, and I shocked myself by actually having fun on a flight! My interest in aviation snowballed from there, and I am now a licensed private pilot! I now look forward to every flight with excitement whether I'm the pilot or passenger. Not sure if this helps your current situation, but I just wanted to share that it's possible to get over the fear."
58,"One bit of advice I can give to help ease your mind while you travel. Keep an eye on the flight attendants, if they're calm and walking around(which is all the time) then there is nothing to worry about."
59,"I developed totally irrational adult onset fear of flying. I'm convinced I'm going down and turbulence has me grabbing the arm rest, closing my eyes and preparing for life to flash before my eyes. The problem is I absolutely live to travel. In the past 2 weeks I have been on 5 flights...I guess you such have to suck it up really. I know that air travel is truly safe and if I want to see the world I have to get there first. I just try to sleep as much as possible on the plane, breathe and keep myself calm, find things I enjoy and remember the good that comes from the airplane. On a more morbid note should anything ever happen on one of my adventures everyone will know I left this world doing the one thing I love most and I can hope it brings them a little bit of solace."
60,"Fellow fearful flyer here. I think Xanax helps, even if it's just partly a placebo effect. It's a claustrophobia thing for me, so I find the bigger the plane the better. 787s are the best, as they are supposed to have less turbulence. I get an aisle seat in the middle of the plane near the wing (you can feel the plane tilt less in the center). Also just understanding how statistically safe it is to fly. Driving a car is way more dangerous than a commercial flight."
61,"Yeah, I think the only cure for me is some old school medication (not alcohol). I'm going to talk to my doc before next possible flight. I flew 3 times in my life and even I have to admit that each time it felt just a tiny little bit less terrible. It still feels like absolute hell though, I'm covered in sweat and feeling deprived of any energy even after 1:30h flight."
62,"I fly a lot and never feared it, but in my travels there have also been months at a time without flying. You can go almost everywhere in the world without flying, even cross oceans, it's just going to take longer and will be more expensive. If you are from Europe, Asia, Africa or the Americas, you already? have a pretty big playground to explore without a plane right in front of your doorstep, if you are from Australia or New Zealand or that's not enough for you, maybe learn sailing? You can take buses cheaply everywhere and trains in Europe too, you can sail from Panama to Colombia, you can take the transsiberian railway to get from Europe to Asia, ferries from Spain to Africa. You could drive a motorcycle from Alaska to Patagonia. You can even get to the Antarctic with a ferry. There are cruise ships and container ships that cross the Atlantic. Or you could just fly."
63,"I fucking hate flying but I deal with it cause I wanna travel. That's pretty much it. Every take off and landing I tense up. Every little shake of turbulence, I'm positive I'm gonna die. Despite all that, i still do it because seeing the world is fucking awesome. I suggest you do the same."
64,"I used to have an intense fear of flying, but I have a couple strategies now. A big one is reminding myself that the pilots of the aircraft, even though we can't see or hear them, are people too, and will do everything in their power to keep the plane flying smoothly. They want to get home to their families at the end of the day and don't want to die just as much as you. Also, all the passengers on the aircraft, can you fathom it's every single persons turn to die on this measly little flight, when there's thousands of other ones on the go at the same time? I don't know why it works, but using these two strategies I can get out of my own head a bit and relax."
65,"A big one is reminding myself that the pilots of the aircraft, even though we can't see or hear them, are people too, and will do everything in their power to keep the plane flying smoothly."
66,"I understand that flying can be super scary - after all, humans weren't evolved to be up in the air. However, the more you feed into a fear, the more it will take hold of you, and the more intense it may get later on. Unfortunately, fears can't usually be extinguished unless you actually face it. You can choose to do land / sea travel, but be aware of the consequences if you do that. Fortunate however, there might be a couple of things that you can keep in mind when you fly. Number one is just to understand the process better, maybe do some research on it (that is, everything about planned, flying, and safety measures). For example, there are videos that show just how much abuse a plane can take and still do its job, so those little bumps from turbulences? They aren't really affecting the plane to any degree that your need to be concerned about. Also look into stats and remind yourself flying is actually the safest way to travel, that thousands of planes are in the air at any given time yet accidents (especially fatal ones) are very rare, so what are the odds of something happening to your plane? A thought like ""even though it's getting a little bumpy, thousands of planes get through these turbulences unscathed, odds are my flight will be fine too,"" is a much better alternative to ""it's getting bumpy! I'm going to die!"" Remind yourself too that anything internal you feel on the flight such as an elevated heart rate or nervousness is just a biological reaction that is not based on reality. Your body is just going into fight or flight mode because it senses danger (like I said, we aren't evolved to fly), even though that danger isn't based on reality, kind of like when you are watching a horror movie. Maybe take a few deep breathes if you begin to feel terrified, but try not to fight the feeling or it might intensify and fuel those negative thoughts. Just be aware that your body is responding in that way and they it's okay, even though it might feel uncomfortable. The more you fly, the less your body will react like that, and it doesn't take too many flights to do that! Whatever you decide, I hope you enjoy wherever you might end up in the future."
67,"I usually listen to music really loud during the take off and landing and for a little while during the flight. After that I watch movies constantly to distract me from the flight. I took an 18 flight last year and was surprised at how smooth it went for me.' Also no coffee or caffeine at least a day ahead and on the flight as well eat the food even if you don't want to it will calm you down , drink water, get up and walk around every hour or so get an aisle seat makes you not feel so trapped, pray it will help clear your mind. (don't pray for the plane to not crash this will not help you remain calm), exercise before you flight, chocolate during the flight, loose clothing and comfortable shoes, that is all I have but has helped me a ton."
68,Having treated flight phobia for over thirty years (airline captain and licensed therapist) I can authoritatively state that exposure therapy doesn't work for airline flying.
69,"I was the same way. My advice is find an anchor (something on the plane or something you can bring, that will relax you). For me it was the safety card in the seat pocket. Eventually after you keep repeating this behavior, the fear should subside. Also, remember flying is the safest mode of transportation."
70,I've always had a fear of flying. I absolutely hate turbulence and think every bump means the plane is going down. Even though I'm afraid of flying I learned that if my ears and eyes are occupied then I can get through even the worst turbulence barely remembering it happened. Usually I turn music on loud enough to be heard over the sound of the plane and read or download movies or shows to watch. It's miraculous!
71,While I actually enjoy flying I do get nervous before a flight. This may be a weird way to calm nerves but a week or so before I head off on a holiday I find myself watching episodes or Air Crash Investigations. Seems stupid watching a show about plane crashes but it reassures me that all the reasons for these crashes have been identified and fixes put in place. This episode reassures me that there are a lot of competent people out there...
72,"I seriously considered never being able to leave North America over my fear of flying (claustrophobia). I tried counselling, mental exercises, etc and that didn't help. I turned to my doctor and was prescribed Ativan."
73,"Im afraid of flying. For years I would shake with fear, cry hysterically, and then finally after one particularly awful flight I refused to fly for a year and took the train everywhere. I did a fear of flying course - didn't help. I tried breathing techniques - didn't help. Eventually I managed to fly again with medication - valium at first, then I moved onto beta blockers because valium made me feel really dopey. Then I started trying to fly without medication, and I found that what really helped me was finding a way to control the panic. I'm still an anxious flier, but if I don't let it progress to outright panic I'm okay (because I find it very hard to calm myself down when I'm panicking). So I'm starting to retrain my brain to think about flying differently (I'm supposed to be doing this for my everyday anxiety as well, but.....yeah). For example, on a recent flight the captain switched on the fasten seatbelt sign. Now my normal response would be absolute blind panic (""oh no! There's going to be turbulence! It's going to be awful! I can't cope!""). But now I think (""okay, there's going to be turbulence. It'll probably be unpleasant, but I will get through it and it will stop.""), tighten the seatbelt (move with the plane, don't fight the turbulence), and put on a movie to distract myself. Before a flight, instead of getting myself really worked up in the departure lounge (I hate flying! What if there's turbulence! Please don't let there be turbulence! I can't do this!) I think ""okay, I'm getting on a plane. It might be a bit bumpy, but we've coped with bumpy before. Looks like they've got some good movies on the inflight entertainment so I'm going to watch those, then I've also downloaded that audiobook that I've wanted to listen to for ages"" I can't control whether there's turbulence or not, but I'm learning to control whether or not I panic about it"
74,"There are courses you can take to get over your fear of flying. I'm not afraid of flying (I'm a pilot), so I've never done them. I've heard they are taught by experienced airline pilots and slowly work on getting you to fly for the first time. The other option is to take re-positioning cruises on cruise ships. Generally in the fall and spring, cruise companies move their boats to new locations. You can take these cruises for super cheap. My uncle does these all the time, because he just loves to eat and doesn't care about the destination."
75,"Someone else said this, but watch the flight attendants. They'll be calm in even the most turbulence. Also, during turbulence, lift your feet off the ground. You'll feel less shaking. Also notice that you can feel the plane shake when someone walks down the aisle past you. The place you're sitting is very susceptible to the most minor movements. Chances are that any turbulence isn't as bad as you think. What's helped me (I still get scared when flying, and I fly ALL the time): I read books and blogs on flying-how it works, what people go through, what pilots are thinking, etc... I've also got a flight attendant friend and her advice is the best. She was afraid of flying and decided to become an attendant o conquer it. She said she flew so much that she just got used to it. She also said it helped knowing that the staff dealing with the plane all have families, pets, homes, things they love, and/or lives to live. They will do all they can to get that plane wherever it needs to go. It's a psychological game you play with yourself. I have xanax, but don't always take it. Now, I sometimes just leave it at home. A beer and the joy of looking out the window at all the beauty down there is usually all I need."
76,"I truly believe exposure helps! Also, flying at night was helpful to me, it felt more like I was on a bus, or something else since I couldn't see outside. Taking an all natural herbal relaxant helps! Looking at other passengers going about their business and realizing if you were in danger everyone would be freaking out... then feeling silly for freaking out in your head. Think/say positive thoughts. And again, exposure!"
77,"Pilot here. Some people have an irrational fear of flying. If that's you, I could describe in as much detail as I like how safe flying is, and it probably wouldn't help you. There are ""fear of flying"" courses you can attend which can help. They typically involve spending some time understanding some of the technical aspects of what's happening, talking to pilots and air traffic controllers, and then going on a short flight, with incredibly understanding flight attendants who will help explain what's happening, what all the noises mean, and so on. Since you specifically asked why you should trust the mechanics, it may be that in your case, your fear isn't totally irrational, but is based on a lack of understanding of flight and aeroplanes, in which case the following will help: First of all, understand that aeroplanes naturally want to fly. The wings are designed to keep the aircraft in the air. The tail is designed to keep the aircraft going straight. The engines aren't even needed for flying - they're just needed to get into the air, and to maintain speed and height. If all the engines stopped, however unlikely that may be, you'd be left with a big glider. One of the few examples of this was the US Airways flight which landed safely in the Hudson after both engines stopped, resulting in zero injuries. The crew did a brilliant job, but the aeroplane was designed to fly, and that's why it was able to fly to a safe splash-down. Having said that, there are certain items which are important in aeroplanes, and yes, engines are one of them. So are flight control systems. And autopilots. All airliners have duplicates of these systems, so that if there is a problem with one, the others can carry on working. A typical airliner will have two engines, three hydraulic systems that are used for moving the control surfaces, and three autopilots. If anything does fail, there will be a backup system to take over. Finally, there's the safety culture that exists within aviation. We all make mistakes from time to time. If we make a mistake driving, we usually forget about it and move on. If the mistake results in an accident, we deny it. In aviation, the opposite is true. When mistakes occur, pilots, engineers, and everyone else in aviation is actively encouraged to report it. Reports are regularly published so that everyone else can learn from them. That means that flying gets safer and safer as we all learn from previous mistakes, and change our procedures to ensure we don't repeat them. It's because of all these things that commercial flying is consistently the safest way, statistically, to get around. I hope that helps, but please do ask if there's anything else you want to know.

78,"One thing I'm sure you're familiar with but didn't mention is the very strict maintenance program used on aircraft, which is another big part of safety. With owning your car, you can probably get away with only replacing things once they break or show signs of being close to breaking, and you might not necessarily know that something is close to breaking until it does. You'll do periodic inspections to check the tire tread and pressure and check the oil level, and check the brake pads and spark plugs and stuff like that every year or so, but you're not going to take apart the engine and start replacing internal components that appear to be working fine or anything like that. Aviation takes an extremely conservative approach to maintenance. They'll tear down the aircraft and completely inspect every component after a few hundred hours of usage, and replace everything that has even a slight chance of failing. They don't just change the transmission fluid every 60,000 miles and hope it will last, they will take it apart, measure all of the gears, check for any chipped teeth or other signs of failure, and replace it if anything's wrong. Other components may be inspected even more frequently if they feel that there's more risk, and the entire aircraft is checked out every time it flies. Additionally, certain components are replaced after an analysis shows that they might have a risk of failure, even if they look perfectly fine. For instance, landing gear undergoes quite a lot of stress during take off and landing. The engineers will analyze how many landings the gear can perform safely. The maintainers will replace the landing gear after x number of landings, even though it looks and works fine and can probably survive many more landings. A maintenance plan like this is very time consuming and expensive, but it's very safe. There's no ""Fly it til it breaks, then worry about fixing it"" attitude- if it has the slightest chance of breaking, it gets fixed."
79,"Finally, there's the safety culture that exists within aviation. We all make mistakes from time to time. If we make a mistake driving, we usually forget about it and move on.

80,That helped me. I always thought if the engines stop the plane drops like a rock. Can you explain turbulence? I was on a 30 person passenger jet one night and we hit such bad turbulence it felt like the plane would drop 300 feet in the air at a time. Never had a fear of flying before that.
81,I have been wanting to ask a pilot this for a while: I am pretty scared of flying not to the point that i won't do it but i am just a nervous wreck on the plane. One thing that freaks me out beyond belief is when the engines are slowed down and you can physically feel like you are slowing down. I always have this vision that the plane is going to nose dive.. Can you explain why this wouldn't happen and what it is they are actually doing when they reduce the power or slow down? Also could you explain what would actually need to happen to stall a commercial jet and what that might feel like if you were a passenger? ie what would be the symptoms leading up to a stall. (hope that makes sense)
82,"I've recently moved to China and my work involves lots of flying around S.E.Asia in little planes. I've never had a problem with flying until my move, but I've suddenly developed an incredibly irrational and cold fear of flying. It terrifies me, and the small planes just exacerbate my fear. What I'd like to say is thank you for taking the time to write your post; it is certainly helping me to rationalise more clearly."
83,"Great explantation. Let me ask you this ... I just flew into LA 3 days ago and there was ZERO warning that we were about to land. The flight attendant got on the intercom and said ""turn off electronic devices and prepare for landing now"" then a couple of them ran around, grabbed laptops in exit rows, stowed them, and quickly sat. We landed right that minute. I asked the flight attendant and they told me the cloud cover was very low and thick. The pilot didn't know how low it actually was. The landing was very smooth but usually everyone gets about 20 minutes to ""prepare for landing"" this was literally about 1 minute before we landed. How does that happen. Let me add, I love flying and believe it is very safe."
84,"Just out of interest, how do the backup autopilots work? I'm assuming that if something goes wrong with the first autopilot, the second would be programmed in the same way and would encounter the same problem. Or is it more to do with hardware issues?"
85,"To add to this, I was taught that flying isn't inherently dangerous; it's unforgiving. The mindset of pilots as I know is is very precise: anything happens, it gets published. New flying orders come out right away. Planes are stripped down and every part x-rated every few hundred hours. Because it's unforgiving, everyone does everything to make sure nothing goes wrong. And it rarely does, if that helps."
86,"Thank you so much for this answer! The gold is well-deserved. To be honest, I don't have an irrational fear of flying, but I am always skeptical when I fly. I really liked your explanation of the back-up systems in place as well as the safety protocols in today's airlines and how serious they are taken. Makes me feel safe. Also, I am so glad that even in the rare occurrence of engine failure, we should survive!"
87,"As a fellow aerophobe I can only say that you should try finding solace in the improbability of a lethal plane crash. There are thousands of flights every day, tens of thousands of flight hours, hundreds of thousands of passengers are flown to and fro, yet plane crashes are getting rarer and rarer every year, despite the fact that the number of flights keeps increasing. Also, were you to actually experience some sort of an accident on board a plane, you should know that, according to a NTSB study (and here's the official PDF of the study itself) of plane accidents, 95,7% of people involved in them, from 1983 to 2000, survived. And even if you only take the worst events, you still have a 76,6% survival rate. Things have only gotten safer since then. Basically getting in an airplane accident of any sort is like winning a lottery. Dying in one is like winning two in a row."
88,"One way that helped me to stand up against my aerophobia was to stay a couple of days in a large airport and state by myself that all those airplanes coming from all around the world, just landed perfectly as planned. The other way was magazines in the plane itself who were explaining how this is working. As a matter of fact, I was just fighting my ignorance, and they were surprisingly very helpful. Now, even if I still have an adrenaline rush when the reactors starts to rumble, I can manage my emotions like a boss."
89,You can see the result of all the safety regulation in the aircraft industry by looking at air crash statistics (the number of people killed in air accidents each year verses the of number of people who fly each year).
90,"You only hear about the unsuccessful flights on the news, and that's not as often as you think. Think of how many successful flights happen every day. Its a very rare chance that something goes wrong."
91,"Think of successful flights every second. Thousands of planes are in the air constantly, and we hear of accidents or goof-ups in the news every few months or years. The entire flight culture is so safety oriented, it's almost ridiculous. For example, most people in life hate checklists. You never run through a checklist when getting into your car, you just get in and go. Pilots love checklists, and run through them throughout a flight. There's a checklist for everything. Also, I can only speak for small airplanes, but in the small plane world, aircraft are required to be inspected by a professional and deemed flight worthy every single year. Then, since flight time for engines is measured in hours rather than miles (like a car), an engine is required to be totally overhauled (broken down, replaced parts, and rebuilt) every 2,000 flight hours or so. An overhaul of an engine typically costs $15,000 to $20,000, when you could have paid only $15,000 for the plane to begin with. Inspections are about a thousand each year as well. I can only imagine that for professional commercial planes, the inspections and maintenance are dozens of times more strenuous and detailed. Planes aren't safe because they are just ""naturally"" that way, they are safe because of the culture behind them. Checklists, inspections, extensive preventative maintenance, and failsafes and backup systems galore, as well as pilots that have thousands upon thousands of flight hours recorded in many different aircraft in all sorts of conditions. If someone is a commercial pilot for a major airline, it means they have been doing it their entire life and have climbed quite a long and difficult ladder to get to that position."
92,"Granted I was in the Navy, but the jets I worked on had EXTREMELY strict rules about maintenance. Breaking a drill bit meant putting the entire bit back together to make sure every bit is found is the norm. It's not directed for you to do by an asshole boss. It's just standard procedure. Done without even being told to do so. One time I remember the entire US Navy downed (not allowed to fly) every single F/A-18 because one of our suppliers of O-ring's was found to have sold counterfeit parts (elsewhere, not even to the US Navy). No problems with them, but they were suspect and so a large portion of the navy stopped flying for a couple days to replace them. I'm sure there were exceptions of course, I'm sure somewhere in the world we had a mission critical flight that could not be delayed. Again, this is a military jet, but I remember reading about 2 F/A-18's colliding in midair. One had half his left wing completely removed. He still made it home and landed on the aircraft carrier. Semi-related: This guy landed his jet and got home as well, skip too 4 min 30 sec for shot of the wing damage: the reason why flying is so much safer over driving is because of extremely strict maintenance and good back-up systems for when things do go wrong."
93,"Although I'm a frequent flier now, I used to be nervous in airplanes. One thing that definitely helps: repetition. Knowing the sounds that planes make, watching the crew respond to chimes and go through their pre-flight/takeoff/landing routines, and basically knowing what is coming next is a huge factor in reducing anxiety and nervousness. Although turbulence still bothers me, experience and repetition has helped there too. I once flew from Sydney to LA with 7 hours of continuously light or moderate chop, where even the crew was seated. Now whenever my flight gets bumpy, I can tell myself ""at least it isn't as bad as that time from Australia......"" etc."
94,"Redundancy. I'm a former aircraft mechanic, so I speak with some experience. Take the navigation system, for instance. There are three channels, L, C, and R. Each channel has its own computer. All three talk each other and compare data - if any computer disagrees, it's ignored. Each of those computers has redundant computers inside it, checking its data internally before sharing it with the others. Every flight critcal system on a commercial airplane has redundancies. Backup backup backups, in some cases. Also, experience. We're not new at the flying game. Planes have crashed and we have learned from those crashes. Mistakes in design have be redesigned and redesigned."
95,"The chance of you being injured or killed is very, very, very low. That's due to the fact that a lot of very intelligent people spend a lot of time thinking about every little thing that goes into building the plane you're on. Maybe the seats aren't as important or the stuff you're in direct contact with but the stuff that's really important gets a LOT of attention."
96,"You are quite more likely to win a typical US state lottery than die or even almost die on a plane. I know what you mean though. When you are driving, you have some form of ""control"" of what's going on. In a plane, you are helpless to do squat should a situation occur. You just have to breathe and realize the odds are immensely in your favor. Works for me."
97,"Since it doesn't look like anyone has mentioned security yet, I want to point out that most of the security stuff you see at the airport is fairly unnecessary. According to the writer Bruce Schneier, the two things that have made airlines much more secure since 9/11 are reinforced cockpit doors, and encouraging passengers to fight and try to overpower a potential hijacker. And they've been very effective. When was the last time a major airline was hijacked? You hear about bombs and such, but the fact remains that none of them have been successful. It's scary to think that they could have been successful, but it's also scary when I trip going down the stairs and realize I could have just fallen to my death. It doesn't mean I shouldn't take stairs, it just means that occasionally danger is too close for comfort. The only foolproof way to prevent someone from doing something dangerous on a plane is to prevent people from going on planes altogether. But remember the odds - you are far more likely to be a target of that kind of violence if you live in a metropolitan area. Billions of people fly every year (according to the IATA there were 2.5 billion passengers in 2009) without ever being in danger. That's billions of people who fly without incident, for whom the biggest problem is the indignity of airport security. Put another way - I'm safer flying through the air than I am walking down the street in my city."
98,... Are you not scared shitless driving on the highway? There's a much greater chance your car will break down than your plane will break down.
99,"you know how you get in a car, and while the driver may not necessarily be a halfwit with a license, most others on the road are halfwits with licenses and youre surrounded by them, yet you get in a car anyway. with airplanes, the pilots are far more highly trained in aircraft operation than any driver is in car operation (id comfortably venture to say more than any professional driver as well). and the higher and longer your flight is for, more highly trained and experienced pilot you have controlling the plane. that on top of strict safety procedures and mechanical redundancy makes flying one of the safest methods of travel, statistically"
100,Pilots are not allowed to fly commercial aircraft until they have at least 2000-5000 hours flying smaller planes to gain experince with how the diffrent flaps control how the plane turns and goes up or down. Most pilots fly in smaller planes more than they do comercial planes just to gain the knowledge needed to fly a comercial plane with little to no error.
101,"When you look into the statistics of modern flight, its significantly safer than automobile travel. Your chances of death in a crash are higher than being injured in a plane."
102,"I have a 6 hours flight, a 2 hour flight and a 1 hour flight in the next 24 hours. I hate flying but I need to take this trip for me. I havedramamine, melatonin, l-trytophan, noise canceling head phones but I still am freightened for some reason. Despite flying numerous times internationally before today."
103,"Learn statistics. I just came here to say this, so glad to see this near the top. seriously, read some stats on planes versus just about any other mode of transportation, especially cars, as i'd take a guess most of us do or ride in without much thought or fear."
104,"Yea this is what allows me to have no fears in flying, but I don't think it works for everyone. Different ways of thinking I guess. People who are scared of flying know the statistics normally, but still are scared of it."
105,"Think about it this way: pilots have taken much more training than most drivers. They are extremely skilled at what they do. It's like if you had a Formula 1 race car driver drive you everywhere. The other thing I like to think about is that once the plane takes off, everything is out of my control. I can't affect anything at that point. If the plane is going to crash, I can't do anything about it. It brings a calmness over me. So I just sit along for the ride."
106,Have a couple drinks before boarding. I personally love to fly. Just keep in mind it's the safest method of transportation
107,"Honestly, very honestly, People are dying everywhere, anytime from everything, no one can run from his destiny, no matter if it's a rollercoaster, flight or just by sitting in his own room in his house eating a cake. Accept the fact that if something will go wrong on the flight, you meant to die today, and that's it - all the fears will go away. I know it might sound a bit brutal, but that's my personal opinion, you don't have to accept that."
108,"I am not necessarily afraid of flying (so not sure if this will help or not) but I'm mostly bothered by the feeling of being trapped/confined in an airplane with no way out or really a way to walk/move around. My go-to is usually trying to sleep as much as possible, whether that be depriving myself of sleep beforehand or just hoping for the best. But being bored is always the worst. Best tips: I get cold easily, so making sure I have a big scarf to use as a blanket, having nice cozy socks on hand in my personal item, and a neck pillow are key. Load up on things to keep you busy; download netflix shows/movies, music, bring a book, notepad/pencil, sudoku, whatever you need to not be bored. Also make sure you remember headphones! I bring some chewy candy/gum for the take off and landing (helps my ear adjust and gives me something to distract). Happy flying! As much as you want to worry, flying is quite a safe way to go! If I get anxious I usually try to remind myself that as far as accidents go, you are far, FAR more likely to be injured in a car than in a plane, and just distract, distract, distract."
109,"I have the same fear as you do, and specially having 0 control of what can happen. When I get anxious I sweat a lot on both hands and feet, and that also makes me get cold. What I find the most beautiful about my fear is that I am completely sure that I wont limit my experiences in this life just for something that isn't rational, I know it is not rational, I can't control it but I won't let it rule me."
110,"Guys, fear of flying is never solved by knowing the statistics. It's a phobia, it's irrational, so I don't think pointing the numbers will help. Your medicine will probably do the trick, and the flights aren't very long. Anyway, try to make your flight as pleasant as possible. Bring a book, download a few games, and have some drinks if that's your thing (and if it won't interfere with the medicine)."
111,"This! I used to be afraid of flying, I forced myself to go flying as many times as I could afford after I realized I was afraid of it and now I can even enjoy it to an extent. Kind of a self inflicted CBT. It did help to have someone I trusted with me that could somewhat assure me that I was okay."
112,"Some good advice in here! To add, I always think to myself, welp, I'd rather be the person who dies in a plane crash on the way to another amazing adventure, than be the person who's too afraid of dying in plane crashes to go on any adventures at all. I've been on a lot of planes and gone to a lot of places, and so far, so good! And if one day I do die in a horribly unlikely plane crash, it would have all been totally worth it. (And probably not that horrible of a way to go tbh)."
113,"just think about this fact, the pilots in the cockpit will do everything in their power to get you home, because they also want to get to their homes. If you start feeling nervous when turbulence begins, just lift your feet for a bit. If it doesn't help, with your thumb and index finger of one hand start massaging the muscle between the thumb and index finger if your other hand (I think is called the pollicis muscle). Finally, there are some areas that usually you should expect turbulence. Such as when taken off if the plane goes thru clouds you will feel turbulence, actually this applies to all cloud crossing. If you are leaving the continent into the water or vice versa, you might also feel turbulence. Check the live flight map and when flying over the ocean, in some area the blue will be darker (deeper) of a lighter (not so deep) colour, crossing between those area you may also experience some turbulence. When you start the descend, the plane will start to shake a bit, nothing to worry about, it's normal. Lastly, try to reserve your seat around the wing area (seatguru.com to pick the best seat), this is where you will feel less turbulence. Some people feel better knowing why the turbulence is happening at that specific moment... don't know why Now if you are flying business or 1st class, just use the full flat-bed seat ...turbulence will be much better while lying down. Safe travel and enjoy your trip"
114,"Gummy bears, lots of them. Hardee's bacon egg & cheese biscuits no matter what time of day, buy them in the morning if you have to. Also, make the person sitting next to you hold your hand thru turbulence or other scary bits. I've flown many times and when alone never had a seat mate unwilling to talk thru the entire flight. Makes time fly! Oh also, take antihistamines to dry out your sinuses and keep your ears from popping, they'll make you drowsy so you can easily fall asleep thru most of the flight if you want."
115,"Therapy. Drinking/drugging yourself into oblivion isn't a good idea (great way to not be allowed on a flight, or to have problems when you land), and doesn't actually address the problem if you have an actual phobia and not just ""flying jitters"". Get a few sessions with a CBT therapist to help you work through your fears and practice coping skills that work for you. Also, the commenter saying to learn about the statistics of flying is spot-on. The best remedy for fear is fact! Planes are safer than driving, and you probably aren't afraid of driving..."
116,"My doctor prescribed me Xanax for flying. I don't take it for flights under 6 hours because I want to be fully aware of everything around me when I get off the plane, especially when arriving at my destination. Shorter flights, I just try to keep busy with reading, music, audio books, podcasts. Eating snacks helps me as well and slowly sipping on a cold beverage with a straw (buy a smoothie, iced tea etc after going through security)."
117,"I used to be horribly afraid of flying, the answer was to keep getting on planes and flying. The more you do it the more you can rationalise it. Now, I have to fly regularly for work and it doesn't phase me at all. I totally get it though. Listening to music you enjoy and means something to you helps as well. It's quite easy to forget where you are and what you're doing. I don't think taking all those drugs will help you in the long run but it's entirely up to you. I can tell you this though, I remember all the great trips, to great places, I've taken and don't remember the flights to get there or back at all."
118,"Occupy your mind during takeoff and landing. I do a crossword so I can feel intensely about a word, for you maybe a book, a movie? A work project?"
119,"I fly with a friend who has a fear from time to time. He had a tendency to try and squeeze the life out of my hand in distraction, so I advise some kind of stress ball, at least to give your hands distraction. His strategy during his more anxious moments was to try and recite the alphabet backwards, try and name all original 150 Pokemon, etc. Sure, he took a Xanax from time to time, but memory strategies took his mind off his fears at the worst times of the flights. Good luck, travel is worth the hardships."
120,"Start your music as soon as the instructions about oxygen masks, etc are over. Lean back and close your eyes. If you find yourself getting restless or bored, work on a crossword, play Candy Crush, or do something else that you enjoy and that will keep your mind occupied. You are going to be okay!!!"
121,"If you're going alone, the first step is to trust yourself. Believe that you're going to be fine with trained pilots who will make their top priority to make sure your trip is safe and fun. Also, bring something like a picture of someone you care about to take your mind off the flight. If possible, try to strike up a conversation with someone on the same flight. You never know if someone is going through motions just like you, so you can keep each other occupied until you land."
122,"Eat light drink Lots of water before the flight, maybe an hour before, then pee the water, drink a sedative to relax. Sleep and wake up. Barely works for me but at least I'm not fretting around. Don't get to sleep cause I'm a light sleeper and that's for 14 hour flights. Currently sleepless on a red eye flight total travel time will be about 12 hours. Don't like flying either but try to meditate or if you are a believer, pray."
123,"Concentrate on your fear of being embarrassed. Truck your mind that is your real fear, watch a movie while listening to music, the more you have going the leases time for your brain to dwell on your fear."
124,"I just don't fly, that's how I deal with it. I went to Berlin by a plane last year, and went back 1800km home by busses and trains etc. Not ONCE did I say to myself 'I should've just flew back'. For me flying just isn't worth it, I hate everything about it; height, passengers, airports, check ins, confinement etc."
125,"Like a plane just disappears into the Indian Ocean with no explanation or trace, and that's not the way I want to go out. And I've been watching this TV show called Air Disasters on the Smithsonian about various plane accidents throughout history. Pilot error, crappy maintenance, lack of regulation, etc. and air travel only gets safer when a flaw kills people, instead of it being tested and implemented. Now all of this had made me afraid of flying and I don't want to disappear or be abducted by aliens via a plane or get that horrible rush of feeling knowing you're gonna die as your plane falls out of the sky."
126,"Keep in mind that with every air disaster they learn something new and update designs, maintenance procedures, pilot training, ATC training, etc. So every crash you see on Air Disasters, instead of thinking ""that could be me,"" think ""that won't be me because whatever happened there, they've fixed it."""
127,"I worked in aerospace for a few years sourcing parts for engines and working to get new engines approved for sale. Aircraft go through an insane amount of testing before they can be used and components are rigorously tested for reliability. Manufacturers for aircraft components need to be approved for each individual part they make, whether it's a critical turbine blade or just a screw. Each part comes with roughly its weight in paperwork so that if things go bad, we know who to blame. That doesn't mean things won't go bad but it does make air travel substantially more reliable than pretty much anything else. While it's not 100%, in general there are 3 common reasons a plane crashes: foreign object damage (usually birds or debris left on the tarmac); human error (and human interaction in flight is going down as automation takes over more and more controls); and ice. You are very unlikely to die in an airplane, especially a commercial aircraft. Not only is reliability a key part of the design, there's a lot of redundancy built in to the design to ensure that multiple failures need to happen before there's a catastrophe."
128,"One high-profile incident does not mean it's a high risk of occurring. The reason that was such a newsworthy story was precisely because it was so strange and unusual. As of last year fatal accidents occurred on only about one out of every 17 million flights, and even when accidents do occur, more than 95% of the passengers survive. The risk exists, but it is very very very minutely rare compared to all the other risks you take in a given day."
129,"MH370 is so famous precisely because this kind of thing is such a rare event. Car crashes are far more frequent, and kill far more people, but they happen so often they're boring at this point. And if you're worried about maintenance, you should worry far more about some 20 year old piece of scrap metal driven by somebody who neglected things like new tires and brake pads crashing into you. Airplane maintenance in comparison is downright impeccable."
130,"The reasoning behind your fear of ""going out"" in a plane versus any other way seems arbitrary. A death is a death and a plane crash is likely to be instantaneous depending on how you crash. Are you really afraid of being abducted by aliens in a plane? That was really random and signals a different root of fear. Facts are facts, and the facts are a plane crash will likely be much quicker of a death than a car crash and much much much less likely, end of story. Not to mention each individual car produced goes through much less rigorous testing and maintenance than any commercial plane. You are just used to cars, but there are many things that could go wrong very easily in a car with no warning; wheel comes off or explodes and you turn into oncoming traffic, brakes fail at a stop light and you get tboned, being crushed in a ball of steel that hopefully you die quickly from, not to mention errors by the millions of 16 year old drivers out there texting."
131,"Airplane crashes are very rare. The main reason there is such a hubbub around them is because they indicate a problem that should be fixed. Whether's the 737's troubled rudder history, maintenance procedures such as what happened with American 191, or pilot training flaws such as the primary cause of the crashes of Delta 191 and American 587. Every incident forces us to rethink how pilots are trained, and how planes are built/maintained. The procedures that were found to be most responsible for the crash of American 191 are now outlawed, pilots received better training in what to do in the event of heavy turbulence since American 587, and tailstrike repairs have been revised since the crash of Japan 123. When an airplane goes down, investigators aim to not just establish which component or procedure was at fault, but also to ensure that a similar event never happens again. If this were the 1950s, you wouldn't want to fly in jets, especially the first one to see commercial use, the De Havilland Comet, it's mostly square windows were found to be most at fault for it spontaneously breaking up in the air, and the only hint was that when the recovered bodies were examined injuries such as ruptured organs and blood vessels were discovered, and were not at all consistent with severe blunt force trauma. Instead, these injuries suggested a sudden and catastrophic loss of cabin pressure, and it turns out, that's exactly what was happening. The 737's troubled rudder history was responsible for two crashes, and almost responsible for a third (the two crashes came up inconclusive). If that third one had crashed, the entire 737 fleet may have been grounded. Unless there are structural problems with the aircraft, such as what we saw with Japan 123, Aloha 243, the chances of an accident at high altitude are near zero, instead, it's mostly during takeoff, landing, and the several minutes after and before them respectively. This is actually why they prohibit the use of electronics and other distraction devices during these phases of flight, to make sure you are as attentive as possible, so if the need to evac or brace comes up, you can do so at a moment's notice, and already have your eyes adjusted to the outside light conditions. Air crashes, depending on the nature of the accident, are survivable. What killed most of Japan 123 were the elements at the crash site. Another notable accident flight is TACA 110, a 737 that was flying over the Gulf of Mexico lost power from both engines in a hailstorm. It was able to successfully land on a New Orleans levy with only one injury (to a passenger who recently had a surgery in the abdominal area, even then, it was minor). This aircraft was later returned to service, later being bought by Southwest, and was retired near the end of 2016. Air Canada Flight 143, often referred to as the Gimli Glider, made a forced emergency landing due to fuel starvation on an abandoned runway turned into a drag strip. The landing saw no injuries, however, the evacuation caused nearly a dozen minor injuries (likely because the center landing gear collapsed upon hitting a median causing a nose-down tilt). A bit of an essay, but comprehensive. The main takeaway is, plane crashes these days are quite a rare occurrence, but when they do happen, a fatality is fairly rare, and not always because of the crash itself. Sometimes it's because of the weather, and other times, it's because emergency response teams aren't as attentive as they should be. I recall that one passenger of Asiana flight 214 (where a local news station said they got the names of the flight crew, and it was clearly a racist troll, ""sum ting wong"" is the tip of the iceberg) was killed by an emergency vehicle rushing to the accident sight.

"
132,"Whether you realize it or not, your survival on a day to day basis is contingent upon others around you not committing human error. Simply driving down the street introduces a risk that an oncoming driver may lose control of the wheel. Because this omnipotent level of risk exists almost everywhere, the already statistically unlikely probability of both pilots becoming incapacitated or disabled can be negated. Focusing now on the safety component, aircraft are built to the absolute highest possible standards available, and strictly regulated by most first world countries. Modern engineering has come a long way in the research, development, testing, and validation of aircraft safety systems, and the statistics surrounding air travel are reflective of such. Safety engineering, or the practice of designing components to a much higher standard than is actually necessary, is also a major contributor to what makes roller coasters, aircraft, bridges and trains extremely safe."
133,"If you let fear determine how you travel, no one can change your view because you let emotions rule you in this circumstance and not logic"
134,"What you might take away from these shows, is that it is never one single factor that contributes to the accident. There is always a chain of events - you never hear about when there was a faulty bolt that was picked up on maintenance, it's only when a faulty bolt is picked up on maintenance AND the part attached to it wasn't properly inspected AND the plane was overloaded AND it was flying through a hurricane. If you look up the stats of exactly how many flights there are, the accidents are the extreme outliers. i find Air Crash Investigations goes into a good amount of detail about how it happened, why it happened and what has been done to stop it from happening again."
135,"Think about how many pilots and flight attendants there are. They fly almost every day, sometimes multiple flights a day for domestic flights. To them flying in an airplane is no more frightening than riding a bus or taking the train. If they aren't worried about it then there is very little reason for a person that flies a couple times per year to be worried about it."
136,"You're more likely to be killed in a car crash than in a plane crash. Plane crashes are really quite rare, which is why when they do happen they're big news. So really if you're not afraid of driving a car you shouldn't be afraid of flying"
137,"The likelihood of you dying in a plane crash is so incredibly slim, it's hardly worth taking notice of. You are far, far more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle. And yet, you continue to drive and/or ride in them, yes?"
138,"I would really like to get over my fear of flying. I'm 31 now and I've been afraid to fly since I was around 21 or 22. Nothing really caused my fear. I flew to my grandpa's funeral and was just fine, never enjoyed takeoff or turbulence but was fine walking around, going to the bathroom to do my makeup even! But the next year, when my mom and sister and I took a trip, I was really scared. On the bigger plane I felt better after take off, and landing has never bothered me. But we went on a little plane and it was so bumpy I was in a great amount of fear the whole time. So much so in fact that I couldn't get on the plane coming home so they had to leave without me. My dad had to pay for my fiance to fly out and drive back home with me in a rental car. That was a terrible time in my life. Growing up my dad was verbally, emotionally and mentally abusive to my mom and us kids. He's a changed man now but back then when I didn't get on that flight... his reaction is something I will never forget and even thinking about it still hurts. Fast forward to now, I haven't travelled by air since then. Now I am married (to the fiance who drove me across countries) and we have kids. Our youngest is almost 3. We would like to air travel again not this summer but next summer. I want to be over this by then for sure. What do you suggest? My plan so far is to read fear of flying books and even research how planes work -- my fear is that it's just wrong to be up in a heavy metal thing so high... I feel like it's going to drop in a race to the ground at any moment and I know this is not true but it's so scary. I live in a small town no airport. But I was thinking about taking a practice flight in the town closest where they do aerial tours in very small planes of the city. I know medication is an option but not a good one for me. I've overcome anxiety and panic that's not related to flying in my personal life without anti anxiety meds. I don't want to be groggy and unable to help my husband with the children. And I want to be a good role model for them. Any advice would be fab. Thank you! I really want to travel the world with my family."
139,"My husband was scared of flying. A couple of things helped - he watched a video (or maybe it was a recording?) where a pilot went through every sound and explained what it was. He also got a Xanax prescription from his doctor. I know you said no drugs, but it doesn't make you groggy or loopy, just calms you down a bit. I take them too sometimes just because travel makes me anxious. Other than that, just doing it over and over until it's no big deal."
140,Study and understand statistics. You should be more scared of your drive to the airport.
141,Even understanding this it doesnt help irrational fears. I know these things and i still get bits a fear. Especially during turbulence. No amount of safety stats will change that.
142,"The best remedy is flying! Exposure therapy. You know the fear is irrational, you've read the statistics (I assume), but it just doesn't feel right. This is probably closely related to your anxiety issues and the issues with your father you mentioned. Use the strategies you've used for your anxiety and apply them to flying. Only option is boarding a plane and using relaxation techniques to calm yourself. Breathing, mindfulness and meditation exercises. Thinking of your living room in great detail. Stuff like that."
143,"Ativan is not a bad idea for a phobia. I know you don't want to, but even just a 0.5mg or even 0.25 should't leave you too groggy. this is an appropriate use of it and not something you need long term like dealing with ongoing anxiety. And agree with forcing yourself to do it."
144,"Here's one way to look at it that might help: Airplanes are scheduled and run just like busses. The plane that you're boarding in the afternoon has probably already done 3-4+ flights that morning, and will do 3-4+ more that evening. All day, every day, for 15+ years. So although from your perspective getting on a plane might be a monumental thing, for the plane and crew, it's not too different than working on a bus or a train. Another interesting thing to consider: when a helicopter's engine fails, it actually doesn't fall out of the sky. Look up autorotation - basically, the rotors can spin with the wind and generate lift to slow the helicopter's descent to a safe speed (it'll be bumpy, but not deadly). Now imagine what a jet can do given the size of its wings."
145,"I would read about how airplanes are built, as well as how they work. They are designed to withstand whatever's thrown their way. You will break before the plane will break. For instance, here's a video of a wing flex test: and a fuller video of plane testing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QCkK_p6TZA. Also, if you are concerned about turbulence, sit near the middle of a plane. That's where turbulence will affect you least."
146,i hate small propeller planes as well. so it's definitely not just you. remember that air travel is safe. the whole of 2017 had ZERO deaths from commercial airline flights. ZERO. think about how many planes are in the air around the world at any given time and consider how amazing that statistic is.
147,"I see a lot of ""landing and take-off"" here and I'm kind of the opposite. For me, it's the being in the air part. Any turbulence and I'm a wreck! That feeling you get when your stomach drops - I cannot even describe the intense anxiety I get. I then start to picture the craziest things (that I know are totally ridiculous) happening. Like when we turn I just picture the plane barrel rolling out of the sky. When we start to land I actually feel better like this hell is finally almost over."
148,Take off and landing. Landing - just because I think the landing gear won't come out and we crash as burn into a fireball. Take off - probably thinking we won't make it and crash and burn.
149,For me simply death. Falling mid air waiting to die
150,"I hate it to not have any control ""up there"". I guess I would love to fly if I am the pilot. But I am generally a very bad passenger."
151,"So I don't think I'm the target you were looking for, as I only have minor flying fears. I guess the fear comes from the fact that when something does go wrong you have: 1. Basically 0 chance of survival. 2. several seconds, of not minutes, that you know you're fucked, before you die. Whem driving a car, I am the one responsible and can break or steer away in order to reduce damage. When sitting besides someone I can 'drive' with them and watch out for dangers. So basically, while flying, safety is out of my control and when things go wrong, you'll inevitably die. That's frightening."
152,"Because I am 100% at the mercy of someone else's decision making. Every time I fly I get into this state of mind where I'm pretty sure this is it, I'm going to die."
153,"I have no fucking clue. But landing and take off scare me the most. Just the feeling of speed in my stomach that I don't like. I don't fancy swings and rollercoasters either. But, I'm forcing myself to fly next week, so I'll either die of fear or get over it."
154,"My wife is very afraid to fly. She said it is primal fear so difficult to put into words. The main thing is being up very high, just a simple but powerful fear of heights. Then being trapped and not in control of changing the circumstances of being afraid amplifies it. I have no fear and after many flights together have taken it as part of her personality. There is no way to get over it, only to cope with it in the moment. She has tried (really tried, like practiced) hypnosis and calming exercises but those just seem to internalize the fear and she ends up throwing up on each flight. Her body just can't handle the stress. The only thing that really works to mitigate the fear is anti-anxiety drugs but she has to take like double or triple the prescribed dose. Then she is a zombie the rest of that travel day until she can sleep it off."
155,"I'm not sure I'd say I'm afraid to fly, exactly, but it certainly makes me nervous. The rational part of me is aware that I have a much, much higher chance of being in a car accident than I do of being on an airplane that experiences some kind of emergency. That said, I drive a late-model Honda with advanced crumple zones, air bags in every conceivable place (even got the ""curtain"" option), I drive the speed limit, and I wear my seatbelt 100% of the time. I believe that even if I'm in a car accident, I stand a very, very good chance of walking away from it. If the plane I'm in falls out of the sky, or explodes, or whatever other horrible shit happens with planes, there's statistically a pretty good probability that I'm going to die."
156,"I am not afraid of flying. I LOVE aviation. I could probably take-off and land a plane safely. But I HATE commercial flying. When you're in a cramped seat, have no or terrible food or drinks and don't know what is going on. If I would be in the cockpit, at least KNOWING what's going on, I would be a lot calmer while flying."
157,"Turbulence throwing our flight attendant a foot in the air and into someone's lap midway through the pilot saying, ""going to be a bit of turbulence"". Afterward she looked quite shaken and the pilot actually got back on to say ""everyone alright then?"" and we all sort of laughed but I was done"
158,"The lack of control in that obviously I'm not flying the thing and thus have to put all my trust into someone else, and it generally seems like an unpleasant way to die if something were to go wrong. Imagine you're sitting peacefully in your seat watching the in flight entertainment, cruising the friendly skies 40,000 feet up at over 500mph. Maybe you lean over to say something to your spouse sitting next to you when suddenly there's a huge BANG behind you. A powerful rush of freezing cold air immediately starts battering you in the face as loose papers, books, phones and other objects start flying past. You want to try to scream out in either fear or shock but inhaling burns your throat and you still feel like you're suffocating. Those handy little oxygen masks dangle in front of your face as you start to feel that quintessential Rollercoaster 'freefall' feeling but it stings to even open your eyes so you may not even notice them.. maybe it's even an overnight flight so in addition to being cold and loud now it's also completely pitch black. Assuming you keep a somewhat level head and manage to put on one of those masks, now you're stuck stationary looking around as the fall continues. The roar of the wind is deafening as your plane continues to plunge back to Earth making it extremely difficult to communicate. Something is obviously wrong but you don't know what and likely can't do anything about it anyway. Your brain pumps into overdrive in survival mode, but you're powerless to try to survive. You don't know if you're going to crash into the ground in the next 30 seconds, maybe you'll float around for the next 30 minutes or maybe you're gonna make it out of this thing. Then you start thinking about how maybe you didn't say goodbye to the loved ones you wanted to, you certainly can't call and tell them now.. if you're lucky enough that they're sitting next to you maybe you can hold their hand as you both spend the unknown amount of time left you have together. Finally after what undoubtedly will feel like an eternity, whether it's thirty seconds of thirty minutes, you'll return to the Earth and in an instant.... Fade to black."
159,"I don't like not being in control. I don't like being the passenger in a car and most car crashes aren't even fatal. Planes don't get into fender benders, they explode in fireballs that kill everyone inside."
160,"I'm afraid that I'm going to end up sitting next to someone who wants to talk to me about how much snowfall MN has had for the last 35 years, and I won't know how to leave that conversation."
161,I was 6 when 9/11 happened and I had a 15 year old brother at the time who discussed details and theories in depth with my parents in front of me. I kinda grew up afraid because of that.
162,"I live close to the busiest and biggest airport in the world. It is the only one near me. Being there is terrifying. There are so many people and it's so loud and everyone is rushing around. Flying in general makes me want to kill myself. I'm afraid of heights, claustrophobic, and hate being stuck anywhere. Flying combines all 3. It's absolute HELL"
163,i feel vulnerable up there.. plus if it goes down im fucked. at least in a car accident i may come out with broken bones but alive
164,"Im not affraid of going up its the taking off and the engine noise that frightens me, i have sensetive ears so it hurts me."
165,"Because if the engines all fail you can't exactly just stop the plane, then get out and push it to a garage. You just fall to your fiery, screaming death from at least 15,000 feet. Also, worried about suicidal pilots and terrorists. It's bad enough that extremists are blowing up planes, what about the pilots who are cruising along then decide they hate their life enough to take another 100 or so passenger's lives? I still fly though, but my anxiety is always ticking."
166,My mother and I are scared of heights so that is why. Also I'm afraid of dying by crashing and being pulverized
167,Afraid that i might fall off the earth
168,"I can't control what happens to the plane, all my trust is going into this driver. I know the physics behind planes and such but it still scares me that something that weighs tonnes and tonnes flies in the air. I also absolutely hate the feeling of free falling, it just makes me sick to my stomach. As a child I never really sat on the swings because it would make me feel sick (no I wasn't afraid of swings). I always get car sick in the car too, I have a weird hypersensitivity to my body being moved and the laws of inertia. Whenever you get turbulence in a plane it not only makes me sick but because of my hypersensitivity to movement I immediately panic and grab something, no matter how short the free fall is."
169,"I will be going on a trip to England in about 60 days. I'm extremely nervous to fly to the point where I feel like I'm on death row waiting for my time to come. I'm going with school so everything is planned in terms of our week there but I feel like backing out last minute. My main fear is the plane crashing. With that, I understand turbulence happens and turbulence doesn't scare me as much but one thing that does it that I can not tell the difference between turbulence and the plane about to crash. I'm very frustrated because I was on a 23 hour flight to the Philippines this summer and I think that's what may have triggered this fear of flying, being crammed on a metal tube for so long. I've tried reading up on statistics but they still aren't being very helpful to calm me down. Is there any way for me to fall asleep for the complete 5 hour ride without wanting to scream my head off out of fear or just not to be afraid, dear travelers? Thank you."
170,"Remember that no commercial airliner has ever, ever crashed due to turbulence. A lot of really, really smart guys and girls spent thousands of hours (each) designing and testing the metal tube you're riding in, so that it can withstand far worse conditions than you would ever experience in the wild. Wing stress test. The key takeaway here was that the wings bent at least 24 feet before they broke. Scraping the runway without landing gear. Stall recovery also features heavily in the test battery. I've personally tested aircraft subsystems, which have to go through an absurd number of electrical safety tests, most notably the lightning test. All subsystems must be tested in such a way that proves they can withstand electromagnetically heavy environment and that they won't contribute much to that environment. They also have to be tested to make sure that they won't fail when other could potentially fail, due to electrically fast transients and surges. They are tested to standards which are more strict than any commercial standards you can think of. Ignore the news. You'll be happier for it in the long run."
171,"Listen to this guy. I'll repeat for better impact. no commercial airliner has ever, ever crashed due to turbulence Also, look at cabin crew faces. They are used to this kind of thing, and they would know if it was something else. If they are smiling as operating business as usual that means everything is ok."
172,"I just had a 10.5 hour flight on Thursday and am extremely afraid of flying. To the point that when I was sat on the plane and taxiing to the runway, I wanted to get off. I even took some Xanax and that didn't help me at all. Honestly, I just used the idea that once I'm on, I'm either going to land and have experienced a whole lot of new adventures, or I miss out on opportunities that may never happen for me again, and I would never forgive myself for it. Honestly, it was one of the smoothest flights I've ever been on as well. Find something to take your mind off the flight. I brought a 3ds and downloaded a movie on YouTube, but I flight entertainment was enough for me. When we did hit a little turbulence, I thought ""what's the worst that can happen?"" and remembered there's nothing I could do about it. Turbulence has never brought a plane down in recent history, and I spent a decent amount of time looking into how planes are built and tested. That really eased my nerves. Also, look at the flight attendants. If they look worried, go ahead and be worried. I did this several times. Not once did they look bothered at all. Seeing them calm, and realizing they do this everyday and know the plane much better than I do helped me tremendously."
173,Thank you. I feel like it's hard for me to feel relaxed during the flight if I were to look at the flight attendants because usually during turbulence they run to their seats and it alarms me as if they were rushing for a worse reason. I have a very overactive mind.
174,I've been around planes my whole life and have flown in planes without engines and small prop planes as well as military transport aircraft. You have to understand that the chances of a plane crashing are extremely slim if you are nervous on planes you could take some nausea pills or others but that being said it'll all be good. You have a higher chance of being killed in a car accident. Just think about your trip ahead and how fun it'll be and you'll be ok.
175,"I have a similar problem that emerged when I was suffering from depression and seems to fluctuate in severity. My doctor prescribed me Valium which helps a little and I also have some meditation apps on my iPad which I play during turbulence. For some reason I can concentrate on those, though I am unable to focus on a movie when I'm freaking out. Also, read everything. I have so much knowledge about planes and flying now and it does help somewhat. My reaction is often physical which makes it hard to control, but I can usually dispel any bad thoughts using the facts that I have. There are some youtube videos where pilots explain what the noises at different stages of the flight are. Look at news stories about turbulence where the plane has been completely safe. A friend of mine is a pilot and said the worst turbulence he experienced was so bad that his whole head was shaking and it was hard for him to see - but the plane was totally fine. In fact, now I'm more concerned about being hit by flying object during turbulence and will frantically make sure all my stuff is zipped up in case it hurts someone. I'm sure you've heard it a million times, but the plane probably won't crash. Not only that, but there's a pretty good chance of survival if it does."
176,"As others have said, just tell your dr about the trip and your fears, so long as you don't have a history of d&a abuse or doctor shopping they should have no problem giving you a couple Xanax or Ativan or something. They'll take the edge right off, you'll probably sleep most of the flight too."
177,"That turbulence you are flying through? In the previous hour, 10 planes likely flew through it too. No plane has ever crashed because of turbulence. Pilots see what you think of as scary turbulence in the same way you see a bit of gravelly road when driving in a 4WD."
178,"Let the flight attendant looking after your section that you're a nervous flyer. They will check in with you to reassure you things are ok after a bumpy stretch, or so it's been in my experience. Definitely agree with bringing your own entertainment to distract you, but if it's a super serious case of anxiety I would talk to your doctor for an rx (seconding that you try it BEFORE you fly, so that you know how it feels to take it, but also to make sure you don't have a surprise reaction). If it's possible, get a seat on the wing as it's the most stable, of to the front of the wing. The back is bounciest."
179,"I have fear of heights, so everytime i ride a plane i always panic when there's turbulence happening"
180,"I am not afraid of flying. I know many things could happen, but I do trust the pilots and companies in general. I also enjoy the feeling when you take off. I don't know..I love flying"
